Juneki Hong is a visiting student from CMU. He will give a talk about his research during the lab meeting tomorrow (Thursday) at 11:30.
He will talk about Transition-Based Dependency Parsing: how to introduce backtracking revision operators to the Arc-Eager action set, and how you could train a parser via coaching. He will also discuss speed-accuracy tradeoffs and beam search, and show some preliminary results.
